Extending Alignak
=================

.. raw:: LaTeX

    \newpage


Alignak is a monitoring framework able to schedule hosts and services checks, but what is it:

    - without the checks? *No real information about my system...*
    - without the live state retention? *Need to always restart from scratch...*
    - without a User Interface to see what happened? *Parsing logs is not that easy for me...*

The next chapters explain what may be done to update the default installed configuration and to
extend Alignak for making it suit your monitoring needs
